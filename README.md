# Ghorg

### Purpose
Github search is terrible. The idea here is quickly clone all org repos into a single directory and use something like ack for searching.

### Use
- `$ ghorg nameoforg`

### Auth
- Create a .env add your personal access token
- If org is behind SSO add it to the token https://help.github.com/articles/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-a-saml-single-sign-on-organization/
